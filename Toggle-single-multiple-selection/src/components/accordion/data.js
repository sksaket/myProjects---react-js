    question: "When was the last time you tried something risky and failed?",
    answer:
      "During my first job as a developer, I was assigned to make a series of changes to a live website for a customer, which I did. They had to be completed within two hours. I had tested these changes before, and they did not work. In the midst of a time crunch, I undid everything. I had to reschedule the process all over again, which upset the customer, as it took me a while to resolve. But I kept the customer informed at all stages so that they were aware of things that we were doing and they finally understood that it was essential to release well-tested changes.  Since then, I have always used a test server for applying all changes and validating them before deploying them to live websites.",

    question: "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.",
    answer:
      "Several months ago, I noticed that some staff schedules had not been completed by my manager. Normally, my manager completes them on time, but he had been dealing with several urgent tasks at the same time. Instead of adding to his workload by complaining, I offered to assist him with some of his workloads. The two of us worked overtime for a week and I helped him catch up on all the things he had fallen behind on. When it comes to teams and projects, I am always willing to go above and beyond to help my team grow",

    question: "When was the last time you disagreed with a supervisor?",
    answer:
      "I once disagreed with my management about how to help a client the best. I talked to them discreetly rather than questioning their authority in front of everyone. I was open and truthful about my concerns about their suggested plan of action. It turned out to be just a simple miscommunication. I learned the need of communicating with my team to avoid a small issue from becoming a bigger problem than it needs to be.",
