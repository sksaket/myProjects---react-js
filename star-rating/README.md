# Star Rating Mini Project

This project showcases a simple and elegant Star Rating system implemented using React.js. Users can interact with a set of 5 stars, and based on their rating, the stars change color. The stars turn yellow on hover, and when a rating is selected, the corresponding number of stars remain yellow, representing the user's rating.

## Features

- **Interactive Rating**: Users can hover over stars and click to select their rating.
- **Dynamic UI**: Stars change color based on user interaction.
- **Responsive**: Adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes.

## Demo

Here's a screenshot of the Star Rating system in action:
